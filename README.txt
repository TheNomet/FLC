This programm allow to generate regular expression given a range of two numbers.

To use it is enough to copy the regexp folder in your pc and launch via cmd line
./do.sh <first number> <second number> <name for the variable> <even>
where <even> is an optional parameter: 
	- if 0 only even numbers are generated
	- if 1 only odd numbers are generated
	- if not present all numbers are generated
